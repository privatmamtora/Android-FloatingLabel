Android-FloatingLabel
=====================

A project to build on Chris Banes' FloatLabelLayout(Gist)

Problem with previous libraries I found, for floating label, was that EditText was always incompletely overloaded. (EditText is a object with so many options)

With Chris Banes' method, a custom view simply wrapped the EditText, leaving the dev to utilize a normal EditText's attributes.

I am going to try add some more fatures for the floating label custom view.
